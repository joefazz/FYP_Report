I'd like to acknowledge Dr. Hong Wei for being my project supervisor. Dan Justin and Dr. Martine Magnan for their continued support through the early stages of my career. Suhail Parmar for contributing to my caffeine levels and providing help with Docker and UNIX. Dan Davis and Max Denning for helping me brainstorm the idea for the project and enduring me talking about frontend for the past year. And finally, my parents, Paul and Joanna Fazzino for being unwaveringly supportive and great role models.
