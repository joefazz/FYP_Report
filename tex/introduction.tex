\chapter{Introduction}

As computers have become more pervasive, coding has become a skill that has graduated past being something that only people who work in laboratories need to concern themselves with, to a skill that has become highly desirable commercially and is starting to be taught in the regular curriculum to children studying at a primary school level \cite{schools}. This has created a demand for beginner friendly coding tools and environments, this project is proposing to provide a tool to fill this niche by creating an online environment where people can get started with basic coding concepts without having to trawl through documentation and technical detail about how to get running with one of the popular languages/tools available.

This project is attempting to lower the barrier to entry for anyone with an internet connection to be able to get started coding with as little overhead as possible.
