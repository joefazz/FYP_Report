Programming is a skill that has only grown in popularity. This project is aiming to replace local tooling that is normally required to start learning with a simple web app that lets users write and execute code without having to install any runtime components that would normally be required when programming. The web app was implemented making crucial use of container technology which is used to provide every user with their own isolated environment. This report is a formal write up of the problems being tackled, research that went into the design of the system, different solutions that were explored, implementation of the system, testing of the system and a discussion of the results with speculation for what the future of the project could look like. 

The resulting application created is fully functioning with an industry tested code editor, full environment with terminal emulator and educational exercises which can be worked through and created. The application runs functionally well on all modern browsers and performance testing shows impressive results across both the front-end and the back-end. Approaches to mitigating security issues are also covered with a proposal of how to defend against kernel exploits also included.
